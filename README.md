<h1><b>Challenge - 3:</b></h1>

<pre>
 Implement a function called count_unique_elements(arr) that takes a list of integers arr as input and returns the count of unique elements in the list.
Your task is to write the implementation code for the count_unique_elements() function using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. Begin by writing test cases to cover various scenarios, and then write the code to make those tests pass.
Here are a few test cases to get you started:
<b>Test Case 1:</b>
assert count_unique_elements([4, 2, 9, 1, 7]) == 5
<b>Test Case 2:</b>
assert count_unique_elements([8, 3, 5, 0, -2, 8, 3]) == 6
<b>Test Case 3:</b>
assert count_unique_elements([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) == 1

Challenge yourself with this coding exercise and follow the TDD process:

:one: Think: Define the requirements and expectations for the `count_unique_elements()` function.
:two: Test: Write test cases that validate the expected behavior of the function.
:three: Code: Implement the `count_unique_elements()` function to count the number of unique elements in the list.
:four: Refactor: If necessary, optimize and improve your code while ensuring the tests remain green.
